# Product Management Dashboard

## Overview
The Product Management Dashboard is a web application that allows users to manage products efficiently. The dashboard includes features for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying product details in a structured tabular format. Users can search, sort, and filter products for better visibility. The application ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## Frontend Features

### Login Page
- **User Authentication**: Secure login form for users.
- **Session Management**: Uses React Context API to manage user sessions.

### Dashboard
- **Product Table**: Displays product details with the following fields:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Category
  - Stock Quantity
  - Actions (Edit/Delete)
- **Add Product**: A form to add new products.
- **Update Product**: Inline editing or a modal to modify product details.
- **Delete Product**: A delete button for each product with a confirmation dialog.

### Search and Sort
- **Search Functionality**: Filter products based on Product Name or Category.
- **Sorting**: Column-based sorting for:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Stock Quantity
  - Category

## Backend Features

### Data Management
- **API Fetching & Caching**: Uses SWR to fetch and cache product data from a mock API or locally defined API routes.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensures data updates (add, update, delete) are reflected using SWRâ€™s revalidation mechanism.

### API Endpoints
- **Fetch Products**: GET `/products`
- **Add Product**: POST `/products`
- **Update Product**: PUT `/products/:id`
- **Delete Product**: DELETE `/products/:id`

## Enhancements (Optional but Encouraged)
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for better performance.
- **Low Stock Highlighting**: Highlight rows where stock is less than 5 items.
- **Category Filtering**: Dropdown filter to refine the product list.
